Information on the companys, contact details and external resources (socials). Easy way for customers to book. All pages will be responsive to the device a customer is using to access the site, for example columns stack on smaller devices and images resize to remain clean where as on computer screens with a large window rows have columns side by side.

### Home Page

This will feature identically on all 3 pages, the fully responsive navigation bar will include links to the Home page, Services, Booking and Contact Us page. The bar will include icons alongside words for each page link.
This section will allow the user to navigate between pages on the site easily across all devices. It also means that the back button is not required.

### Design choices
I chose an appealing logo relevant to the company and based the colour scheme around this. I tried to make all text clear and easy to read as well as images eye catching. Colours were reviewed when looking at accessibilty of the site, such as the body text was updated from black to white for ease of reading and contrast between text and background.

### Manual Testing
I have extensively tested all pages of the website. All links connect to the right pages and external resources. When I go from different brower sizes the pages are reactive and clear.

I tested the site personally on my apple iPhone iOS device, going through the process on the safari browser, checking navigation links and functions.
The site was sent to friends and relatives for them to follow the same process. They have tested on their devices, including iOS.

The site was developed on my laptop using google chrome browser so also majority of testing was conducted on chrome, with marginal testibng on Edge,

## Deployment
Detailed steps of how you deployed live version of project.

## Citation of all sources (code, images,text)
Any code you have used from online, aknowledge the developer  who came up with it. Link to website/article and mention author's name.

## Future features
A user to be able to create a profile to return to that rememers their details and previous bookings.

After having spoken to my mentor and reviewing my README.md we have identified that it would be beneficial to break up my commits into smaller chunks with better descriptions. I will ensure to do this in the future.
